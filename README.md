# **Summary**

## Project Specification
Create a blogging application that allows users to do the following:
- register an account
- login
- logout

Once logged in, a user should be able to:
- create a post
- view a list of their own posts
- view a list of everyone's posts
- view a specific post, including the comments people have made about it
- leave a comment on a post

Prior to coding, determine the following:
- your tables: what columns will they have? How will they connect to one another?
- your routes: what routes should you have? What should each route do?
Once you are done designing your application, then proceed with coding.

## **BCrypt part**
Add encryption to your blog application so that your user's passwords are stored safely. Do this in a new branch called "encryption", then merge this back into your main branch.
